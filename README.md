## unused.py
This is not "unused" code per say but actually the opposite. This file contains all iterations of the code as I wrote it. Any time I found a way to do things different, or had to change/delete code that wasn't working how I wanted, I would first comment it out, before eventually copying and pasting everything to unused.py. This was done to a) keep clean the final code, and b) keep a record of all the code that worked and didn't work. I plan in the future to go back through this file and add make it easier to read and perhaps add an analysis of it to the readme.
